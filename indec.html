      <p class="section-text">It was in these moments that love started to heal the wounds of the past and paint our hearts with the colors of forever💗✨</p>
      <div class="events">
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today is the best day of my life! It’s the 14th of September — the day I met a girl named Prajakta. And you know what? She’s absolutely amazing — and honestly, really cute too. (Wait a second… Sahil, is this the first time you’re actually appreciating a girl?) Well, yeah — but she truly was something special!</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>So, today is the second day and I really wanted to talk to her. And guess what? I finally did — I actually texted a girl first! But hey, just to be clear — I'm not in love with her. This is just the beginning of a true friendship.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>It was the day of Navratri — 11th October 2024! I saw Prajakta in her ghagra, and she looked so pretty. (This was the first time I had ever liked a girl this much.)</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>You know what? Today Prajakta was upset with me — because I pretended to forget her birthday (just joking with her!). But of course, I actually remembered it — she told me once, and I didn’t forget. Her birthday is on the 20th of April, 2006.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Guess what? I spent more than 3 hours with Prajakta today — and you know what? I didn’t even feel bored for a second! She even showed me her childhood pictures… and damn, she was even cuter back then than she is now (and that’s saying something!).</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>And today is the day I fell in love with her — 30th October 2024. This is a date I’ll never forget in my life. She trusts me and takes care of me more than I ever could’ve imagined. Honestly, she’s been there for me more than I could have ever asked for.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today is the 31st of October, and I gave her some chaklis. She loved them so much! And you know what she told her mom? "Who gave you this?" (Tumcya javai ne dili ye) Hearing that just made me even happier.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>So, it’s Diwali today, and I went to meet Prajakta. And guess what? She was looking absolutely amazing in her traditional pink kurti. Today was the first time I’ve ever felt nervous about making eye contact with someone — because she looked so cute.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Heyyy! Today is the happiest day of my life — the 5th of November. Today, I proposed to Prajakta, and she accepted me. And you know what? She calls me "MY BABY".</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today, I was really upset and sad because I disappeared for 10 hours, and Prajakta was just upset with me. You know, she’s the perfect girl for me because even though she was angry, she still said to me, “J1 krr pahile tu.” But finally, she listened to me and started talking again.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today is the 12th of November, and she called me "Aho" for the first time. Hearing her say "Aho" felt so special — it felt like she was calling me in the traditional Maharashtrian way, almost like she’s my wife. It was such a beautiful moment.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>You know, yesterday was such a special day in my life — the 3rd of December, 2024. I hugged a girl for the first time, and it felt amazing. I’m so happy that she’s only mine, and I promise to always stay loyal to her. This is a promise I made to myself and to her.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>But I’m worried because for the next 4 years, I won’t be in Nashik. So, who will take care of my baby? You know, she might even ask her parents if she can take admission for the second year at COEP.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Hey, so it was the 9th of December, and that day Prajakta was really sad because I told her that two girls had proposed to me, and they were 100X better looking than her. (But I said that to her because I really like her possessiveness!) Unfortunately, she took it seriously, and I think she was feeling insecure at that moment, which is why she was so upset. But, in the end, I hugged her tightly on her scooty, and she finally listened to me.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Yesterday, I was missing Prajakta so much because I couldn’t meet her, and she was trying to meet me too. But you know, whenever I touch or hug her, it feels like magic. And every time I look at her closely, I wonder how someone can be so cute. She’s truly the Miss Universe in my eyes, and whenever I see her, it feels like she’s the one who could be my wife.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>So, yesterday was the 14th of December, and I kissed Prajakta for the first time on her cheeks. She kissed me back too. Today, I really wanted to be with her, but her mom was calling, so she had to leave me. But she’s amazing (yeah, a bit crazy, but majhic too).</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>And today is the best day of my entire life — it's the 1st of January, 2025, and finally, she said YES. My love is mine now. I also gave her Cadbury (Dairy Milk Oreo Silk) and three Harry Potter Kinder Joys. Although, in those, there wasn’t a Harry. My baby really wanted to get Harry, but I wasn’t able to bring the original one.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>But this is a day I will always remember in my life. Today, I went to Navsha Ganpati with her, and we tied a wishing bell there. I also prayed to Ganpati Bappa, telling him that all I need is her. I wish that Bappa will never disappoint me.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>It’s the 7th of January, 2025, and I kissed Prajakta for the first time! But it happened accidentally. Either way, it was the best experience. I thought she’d scold me, but she didn’t.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>It’s the 11th of February — the day of the JEE Mains result. I was really scared about my result; it was stressing me out. But my Radha said everything would be fine. Later, I went home, and at 11:30 PM, I got the result. When I checked, it was 92.3827362. Just like Radha said, everything turned out fine. I was so excited to tell her the result, so the next day, I went to her and said, “I got 90+!” She was even happier than me.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>On my birthday, the 18th of March, 2025, she planned everything so perfectly. At midnight, she wished me with the most thoughtful messages. The next day, she surprised me with a wallet and an olive green-colored cup. She also bought one of the best cakes I’ve ever seen. After that, we went to Kalaram Mandir to seek blessings from Lord Rama for a beautiful journey ahead. Then, we came back home, and even though I was really tired, I still talked with my baby.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>So, today’s the 10th of April, 2025, and my baby finally got the iPhone 16 Plus. She’s been waiting for it for the last 7 years, and now she finally has it. I was so happy to see her reaction when she got the iPhone — it was priceless. Now, my baby will be able to create the videos she’s always wanted, with me by her side. I’m also so happy that her father is glad for her, especially since she expected just an iPhone and got the iPhone 16 Plus. This is truly the happiest day of my life.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today it's April 27, 2025. Today, my Praju and I visited one of the 12 Jyotirlingas — Trimbakeshwar, and had a divine darshan of Mahadev. My baby wore a green kurti and looked super cute. We stood in line for an hour for darshan and clicked lots of adorable photos later. After that, we enjoyed the famous Sadhana Misal in Nashik and then came back home.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today, on the 10th of May, we visited the breathtaking Bhandardara Waterfall. Surrounded by nature's beauty, the cascading water made the moment feel magical, and I couldn't help but feel so grateful to share such a peaceful and unforgettable experience with her.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today it's July 11, 2025. So today, we went to Necklace Waterfall near Pahine in Nashik, and it was such an amazing experience. We walked through the heavy rain and got completely drenched, but it was so much fun! We enjoyed a lot! Later, my baby started feeling really cold, so we quickly had some momos and biryani, and then we came back home.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Today it's July 21, 2025. So today, Praju and I went to watch our first movie together — it was Saiyaara, and that movie really inspires everyone to love deeply. Just like that, my Praju is my Saiyaara too, and I can do anything for her. We enjoyed a lot! After the movie, we had pani puri and then came back home.</p>
</div>
        <div class="event-card"><i class=""></i><p>Finally, today was our first anniversary. And the best part — it was a Sunday, which made the day even more special. My baby secretly came out of her home, and she wore her beautiful white birthday dress. She looked absolutely stunning and so pretty. After that, we went to a cozy café on Gangapur Road. We clicked lots of amazing pictures together, capturing every precious memory. Later, we exchanged gifts, enjoyed delicious pizza, and spent the whole time laughing, loving, and cherishing each other. Finally, we came back home — and honestly, this was the most beloved day of our life.</p>
